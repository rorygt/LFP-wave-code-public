% PMKMP Returns perceptually balanced colormaps with rainbow-like colors
%   PMKMP(N,SCHEME) returns an Nx3 colormap. 
%   usage: map=pmkmp(n,scheme);
%
% JUSTIFICATION: rainbow, or spectrum color schemes are considered a poor
% choice for scientific data display by many in the scientific community
% (see for example reference 1 and 2) in that they introduce artifacts 
% that mislead the viewer. "The rainbow color map appears as if it’s separated
% into bands of almost constant hue, with sharp transitions between hues. 
% Viewers perceive these sharp transitions as sharp transitions in the data,
% even when this is not the casein how regularly spaced (interval) data are
% displayed (quoted from reference 1). This submission is intended to share
% the results of my work to create more perceptually balanced, 
% rainbow-like color maps. Please see output arguments section for descriptions.
%
%
%   arguments: (input)
%   scheme - can be one of the following strings:
%     'IsoL'       Lab-based isoluminant rainbow with constant luminance L*=60
%                  For interval data displayed with external lighting
%
%     'CubicL'	   Lab-based rainbow scheme with cubic-law luminance (default)
%                  For interval data displayed without external lighting
%
%     'Edge'       Diverging Black-blue-cyan-white-yellow-red-black scheme
%                  For ratio data (ordered, constant scale, natural zero)  
%
%   n - scalar specifying number of points in the colorbar. Maximum n=256
%      If n is not specified, the size of the colormap is determined by the
%      current figure. If no figure exists, MATLAB creates one.
%
%
%   arguments: (output)
%   map - colormap of the chosen scheme
%   - IsoL is based on work in paper 2 in the reference section.
%     In both this paper and in several others this is indicated as the
%     best for displaying interval data with external lighting.
%     This is so as to allow the lighting to provide the shading to
%     highlight the details of interest. If lighting is combined with a
%     colormap that has its own luminance function associated - even as
%     simple as a linear increase this will confuse the viewer. The only 
%     difference from the paper is that I changed the value of constant 
%     luminance to L*=60 to make it brighter that the authors' example.
%
%   - CubicL too is based on some of the ideas in paper 2 in the 
%      reference section but rather than using a linearly increasing
%      L* function such as the one used by those authors, I am
%      using a compressive or cubic law function for the increase in 
%      L*.  L* ranges between 31 and 90 in the violet to yellowish 
%      portion of the colormap, then decreases to about 80 to get 
%      to the red (please refer to figure L_a_b_PlotsCubicL.png).
%      The choice to start at 31 was a matter of taste. 
%      I like having violet instead of black at the cold end of the
%      colormap. The latter choice was so as to have red and not
%      white at the warm end  of the colorbar, which is also a 
%      matter of personal taste. As a result,  there is an inversion in 
%      the L* trend, but I believe because it is a smooth one that
%      this is an acceptable compromise and the resulting
%      colormap is much of an improvement over the standard 
%      rainbow or spectrum schemes, which  typically have at least 3 sharp 
%      L* inversions. Please run CompareLabPlotsUsingColorspace.m or see
%      figures: L_plot_for_CubicL_colormap.png, L_plot_for_jet_colormap.png,
%      and L_plot_for_spectrum_colormap.png for a demonstration
%
%   - Edge is based on the Goethe Edge Colors described in the book in 
%     reference 3. In practice the colormap resembles a cold color map attached
%     to a warm color map. But the science behind it is rigorous and the
%     experimental work is based on is very intriguing to me: an alternative
%     to the Newtonian spectrum. This is not perceptually balanced in a
%     strict sense but because it does not have green it is perceptually
%     improved in a harmonious sense (refer to paper reference 10 for a review
%     of the concept of harmony in color visualization).
